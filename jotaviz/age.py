def age(born, as_of=None):
    """
    Returns the current age, in years, of a person born on the provided date.
    
    First argument should be the birthdate and can be a datetime.date or 
    datetime.datetime object, although datetimes will be converted to a date object
    and hours, minutes and seconds will not be part of the calculation.
    
    The second argument is the `as of` date that the person's age will be calculate at.
    By default, it is not provided and the age is returned as of the current date.
    But if you wanted to calculate someone's age at a past or future date, you could
    do that by providing the `as_of` date as the second argument
    
    Example usage:
    
        >>> import jotaviz
        >>> from datetime import datetime
        >>> dob = datetime(1982, 07, 22)
        >>> jotaviz.age(dob)
        29
