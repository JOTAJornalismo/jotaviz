    Accepts paired lists and returns a number between -1 and 1, 
    known as Pearson's r, that indicates of how closely correlated 
    the two datasets are.
    
    A score of close to one indicates a high positive correlation.
    That means that X tends to be big when Y is big.
    
    A score close to negative one indicates a high negative correlation.
    That means X tends to be small when Y is big.
    
    A score close to zero indicates little correlation between the two
    datasets.

    h3. A Warning

        Correlation does not equal causation. Just because the two
        datasets are closely related doesn't not mean that one causes
        the other to be the way it is.
